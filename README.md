# Robot car workshop
*FORMLABS x ISEEQ x RESOLOON*

In this workshop we built a robot car, which can go, and turn around if it would hit a wall. It can be programmed to do more complicated tasks. The documentation of the project is written here plus in the presentation directory with my whole presentation. 

Feel free to build it at home even if you missed the workshop!

## BOM - bill of materials
You can find the BOM xml file in the repo, which contains everything you need to build the robot - all from [HEstore](https://www.hestore.hu/) (based in Hungary, ships to nearby countries). It doesn't contain the 3D printed base of the car. 

## CAD
The CAD design was done in Oneshape, which is a really great, browser based CAD software with all of the features you need for basic 3D modelling.


My design is available here: [Onshape link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c0c6b1d6464696af57e9dadc/w/3ff449f94ac21dbc34191623/e/c23118844ff9a8772e69ace6?renderMode=0&uiState=693702fb0922c10ba5e02668)

This model can be printed on basically every 3D printer, just make sure you have the right orientation of the model.
